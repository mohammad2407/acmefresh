                <p>Indoor Hydroponics farming instantly solves the issues of geographical constraints.</p>
                <br />

                <p>Rise Hydroponics has successfully setup various indoor farms across so many Indian states. We believe that Indoor Hydroponics Farms combat these pressing issues faced by our world that’s witnessing an enormous growth of population:</p>

                    <b>Pollution & Low Nutritional Value:</b>Traditional field based farming has to counter the issues of polluted water and bad quality air. This impacts the food quality and degrades the nutritional value.

                <p>
                    <b>Water shortage: </b>Field based farming uses plenty of water to grow crops. On the other hand many countries are now facing water shortage due to wastage of water in other areas. You’ll be amazed to know that Hydroponics based farming uses only 10% water as compared to the water taken up by soil based farming.

                    NFT means Nutrient Film Technique.
                    In this method, mineral-nutrient solution is added to the water.
                    These nutrients are then carried by the flowing water that passes through the roots of the plants. NFT always has the roots hung for proper exposure to air.

                    In Vertical NFT System of Hydroponics, plants are installed in multiple layers. These layers are then stacked one above the other. This helps in maximizing the yield per acre and leads to more food grown using hydroponics.
